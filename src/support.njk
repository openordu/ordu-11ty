            <p>The Openordú Project is a public resource guide supporting the practice of Celtic Paganism. Inspired by the Open Siddur project, it aims to create a free software toolkit and a text-base to generate a comprehensive website. It encourages sharing, learning, and the development of Celtic culture. Its components include source texts, praxes, and a user-friendly website interface. Open to contributors, the project also plans to build a Public Celtic Encyclopedia with a focus on practical application over theory.</p>

Frontmatter is a section of metadata that is often included at the beginning of a document, typically in a format such as YAML or JSON. In the context of a static site generator or content management system, frontmatter is used to define additional information about a piece of content beyond its actual text, such as its title, author, date, tags, and more.

It is often used in conjunction with markdown files to provide additional context for the content. For example, a blog post written in markdown might have frontmatter that specifies the post's title, author, date, and tags. This metadata can be used by the static site generator or content management system to generate the appropriate HTML output, apply appropriate styles, or filter and sort content.

Static site generators like Jekyll and Hugo use it to define variables that can be used in the templates. This can make it easy to create a consistent design for a website and update it quickly when changes are needed.

## What is the Openordú Project?
Please see [About](/about).

## What is the purpose of the project?
Please see the [Vision](/posts/vision/).

## How can I contribute to the project?
Currently only through forking our project in github and submitting a pull
request back to our project. If you send us a communication, we can add your
github account to a list of contributors who have access to work within our own
project.

## What are the technical components used in the project?
The project is built on **Nodejs**, [11ty](http://11ty.dev), **Bootstrap**, **Nunjucks**,
and **Markdown**. These technologies form the foundation for the development of a
high-quality hyper-accessible website and associated tools. Additionally, there
are supporting custom **Nodejs** modules, components and filters utilized to
enhance the functionalities of the project.

## What is the Public Celtic Encyclopedia?
The Public Celtic Encyclopedia is an integral part of the Openordú Project. It
serves as a comprehensive list of growing topics that cover various aspects of
Celtic Paganism. The encyclopedia aims to provide accurate, culturally
responsible, and complete information that contributes to a deeper understanding
and practice of Celtic Paganism.

## How can I join the clan and practice Celtic Paganism?
Membership in the clan is open to anyone interested in practicing Celtic
Paganism, regardless of their Celtic background. The clan, known as the Ó Déisi,
Mac Déisi, Déiseanna, or Ap Deiliad depending on the Celtic language, is
designed to connect individuals who share a love for Celtic Paganism and wish to
actively participate in its culture and rituals. To join, you can express your
interest by filling out the provided interest form, and you will receive updates
and information on how to become a member.

## What is the significance of the Déisi tribe and its connection to the project?
We believe that you cannot divorce a culture from its people. And so we've
created an affinity kinship as a group that practices the culture tied to these
texts. I have direct Déisi cultural connections. The Déisi tribe holds
historical significance in Celtic culture and by claiming descendance from
*Dyeus, the deity associated with tillage and agriculture, our new tribe
establishes a connection to the agricultural practices of the past. The project
draws inspiration from the original Déisi tribe and recognizes the Dagda, the
Good God, as the first ancestor (dies pater) and the Hag of Caheracalla as our
Beansí. This ancestral connection serves as a guiding principle in the
development of Celtic Paganism within the project.

## What's this I hear about virtual pilgrimages and engaging with the local land goddess?
You only have to do this if you want to consider yourself one of the
Déiseanna. Otherwise, take what you will from the licensed material and use it
as you will. We have a non-Christian influenced conception of the soul which
is required to be considered part of the Déiseanna, [Learn More](/guides/beginner).

## What is the role of the Public Celtic Encyclopedia, and how can I contribute to it?
The PCE's role within this project is to provide a basis of knowledge per topic,
to have something over which the project can iterate, improve and release. Folks
searching these topics will be able to find them.

## What is the long-term strategy for the project?
To exist, to be used, to be edited and improved. As a culture repository we
would like to grow our secondary goals into more than what is stated here as any
need for it might come.

## How can I stay updated on the progress and development of the project?
We use an open protocol called ActivityPub to publish all updates. In order to
subscribe to our Activity, you must have an account on a service which
understands Activity pub. Once you are, you can subscribe to any Activity Pub
stream, including ours. To get started, visit out [Mastodon](/mastodon) server.
During the sign up process, you'll be presented with an opportunity to subscribe
to [@Celtibot](http://mastodon.celticpaganism.org/@Celtibot) who publishes the updates.

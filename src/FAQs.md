## What is the Openordú Project?
The Openordú Project is an initiative that aims to redefine and revitalize Celtic Pagan practices. It draws inspiration from scholars such as Barry Cunlife, James Mackillop, Daithi O hOgain, John Rhŷs, Marie-Louise Sjoestedt, Proinsias Mac Cana, Thomas Charles-Edwards, Kuno Meyer, Whitley Stokes, Nora K. Chadwick, Julius Pokorny, Rachel Bromwich, D. A. Binchy, Tomás de Bhaldraithe, and Rudolf Thurneysen. Through academic research and the collaborative effort of contributors, the project seeks to develop a comprehensive understanding of Celtic Paganism.

## What is the purpose of the project?
The project's purpose is to create a culture, religion, and community for those interested in practicing Celtic Paganism. It aims to provide a well-thought-out worldview and practice based on the principles of animism, comparative polytheism, tri-functional theory, and extensive research conducted by scholars in the field. The project intends to redefine rituals, liturgy, legal structures, art, music, calendars, and customs within the context of Celtic Paganism.

## What are the technical components used in the project?
The project is built on Node.js, 11ty, Bootstrap, Nunjucks, and Markdown. These technologies form the foundation for the development of a high-quality hyper-accessible website and associated tools. Additionally, there are supporting custom Node.js modules utilized to enhance the functionalities of the project.

## What is the Public Celtic Encyclopedia?
The Public Celtic Encyclopedia is an integral part of the Openordú Project. It serves as a comprehensive resource that covers various aspects of Celtic Paganism, including history, polytheology, liturgy, legal structures, art, music, calendars, and customs. The encyclopedia aims to provide accurate, culturally responsible, and complete information that contributes to a deeper understanding and practice of Celtic Paganism.

## How can I join the clan and practice Celtic Paganism?
Membership in the clan is open to anyone interested in practicing Celtic Paganism, regardless of their Celtic background. The clan, known as the Ó Déisi, Mac Déisi, Déiseanna, or Ap Deiliad depending on the Celtic language, is designed to connect individuals who share a love for Celtic Paganism and wish to actively participate in its culture and rituals. To join, you can express your interest by filling out the provided interest form, and you will receive updates and information on how to become a member.

## What is the significance of the Déisi tribe and its connection to the project?
The Déisi tribe holds historical significance in Celtic culture. By claiming descendancy from *Dyeus, the deity associated with tillage and agriculture, the tribe establishes a connection to the agricultural practices of the past. The project draws inspiration from the Déisi tribe and recognizes the Dagda, the Good God, as the first ancestor (dies pater). This ancestral connection serves as a guiding principle in the development of Celtic Paganism within the project.

## How can I participate in virtual pilgrimages and engage with the local land goddess?
The project emphasizes the importance of engaging with the local land goddess and participating in virtual pilgrimages. One notable pilgrimage is to the fort of the Hag, known as Cahercalla, near Magh Adhair in Clare. By exploring the website, you can find resources and guidance on how to participate in these virtual pilgrimages and connect with the local land goddess.

## What is the role of the Public Celtic Encyclopedia, and how can I contribute to it?
The Public Celtic Encyclopedia is a collaborative effort to create a comprehensive repository of knowledge on Celtic Paganism. It covers a wide range of topics, including myths, history, practices, and more. Contributions to the encyclopedia are welcome, and you can participate by submitting articles, research papers, translations, or other relevant content. Guidelines for contributions will be provided to ensure accuracy, academic rigor, and cultural sensitivity.

## What topics does the encyclopedia cover, and how is it organized?

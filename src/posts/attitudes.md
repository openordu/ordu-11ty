summary: In Celtic Paganism, we believe certain noble attitudes are crucial for connecting with our Béan Sí. Highlighting the importance of active anti-racism and creating genuine diversity, rather than superficial representation, we reject the notion that Indo-European paganism is inherently racist and can be exercised in a way that emphasizes inclusivity. Other topics explored include anti-fascism, critical thinking, language's impact on perception, and the significance of emulation. We encourage individuals to compile their own practices and respect the Celtic Pagan tradition. In conclusion, noble attitudes, critical thinking, and inclusivity are vital in Celtic Paganism's pursuit of a meaningful connection with our Béan Sí.

Here, if you worship our Béan Sí and bring in these noble attitudes into your
 heart, you will domesticate yourself as a hospitable place for Her to live.

## Anti-racist
Being non-racist isn't enough. Though our order's actions will adhere to our
 project's goals, we encourage our members or subgroups to organize anti-racist
 efforts as part of their own goals and organizations. One of our duties toward
 these goals is filtering out racism and racist attitudes within our own spaces
 and separate ourselves from its sources.

We welcome POC and BIPOC and are eager at those who want join us for the
 benefits that sharing creates. Indigenous religions are steeped in the Old Ways
 and we would be happy to have diverse festivals held with a kind of spiritual
 ecumenicism.

And, we will not pander to appeal to others, as that is disingenuous. We're not
 interested in changing who we are and we want BIPOC, especially Celticly
 inclined BIPOC, to be involved with us because of who we are, not just because
 of our BIPOC facing expressions. Instead, we're making who we currently are
 better by the practice of revisiting all of our latent assumptions about race
 and privilege. And if we appeal to a wider audience than those who identify
 like we do, our identification expands in-time to encompass this audience.

## Anti-fascist
We define fascism from a serious study of it as an ideology which doesn't
 celebrate pluralism and that creates a state vs state enemies dichotomy out of
 its body of diverse citizens.

Among those embracing pluralism, there is within us a pluralism of attributes,
 both covert and overt. There are things that bind us, but none of these
 attributes need separate or divide us. Requiring rigorous logic when doing
 anything serious and acting without haste are marks of a wise people.

## Nationalism vs Ultra-nationalism
Nationalism we define as having a special identity and we view that as coming
 with a special duty and relationship with those who share in that identity.

Ultranationalism, a core element of fascism, we define as having a sense of
 exclusive or purist identity and viewing that as coming with an exclusive duty
 and relationship only with those who share in it.

Nationalism is how both America and Ireland won Independence. Black Nationalism
 exists to uphold the cultural uniqueness of Black people. The noble
 Black-Panthers were Black Nationalists. The Ó Déisi clan are certainly a
 Psycho-ethnicity which is a kind of nationalism or patriotism in our usage of
 the word. Those who feel they belong to this new clan we are creating do indeed
 belong to it, and they do have a special duty to those others who share in this
 belonging.

This project, culture, and clan has zero room or tolerance to for
 ultra-nationalism, purism or exclusivity.

## Celtophilia / Celtophobia
*Celtophilia* can be described as an excessive admiration for anything associated
with the Celtic name, often surpassing its actual merits. It is important to
strike a balance in appreciating Celtic culture without romanticizing or
exaggerating its qualities. Similarly, Celtophobia refers to a reluctance to
acknowledge Celtic commonalities or the tendency to resist highlighting shared
Celtic heritage. However, recognizing and celebrating the commonalities among
Celtic cultures does not diminish their unique distinctions. It is crucial to
avoid these extremes and engage in respectful discussions that honor the rich
diversity within Celtic traditions.
 
Celtophiles can exist at all levels of study. Some scholars love the Druids but
 can can barely conceive of human sacrifice among them, though it is very highly
 likely that it simply was a part of regular Celtic life to see a person
 sacrificed. Throughout many books they grant them reprieves at every turn. The
 Celts being awesome at every turn is entropically imbalanced, aka too good to
 be true, and therefore you can bet that scenario is false.

*Celtophobia*, on the other hand, is a reluctance to use the term Celtic, a
 reluctance to see Celtic languages as related, or the tendency to get upset
 when Celtic commonalities are highlighted. Fear that your favorite Celtic
 culture will be seen as less unique or the same as another are insecurities.
 Your fear or arguments will not change the trajectories for which these
 cultures are already on course. Nobody worth interacting with in the study of
 Celtic cultures thinks those cultures as the same. Highlighting their
 commonalities and calling them Celtic doesn't eliminate the real distinctions
 between these cultures, therefore they don't need defending. 

Both of these ways of being are traps, they both over-romanticize one part,
level, layer, or order of magnitude. Try to avoid them.

## Anti-credulity
We value critical thinking. We monitor ourselves for flights of fancy. We are
 aware when our inner selves simply want to desire something to be true, and we
 know what it looks like when our inner selves select data that agrees with us.
 We fight against those tendencies. We know when we are explaining a phenomenon
 with the least simple explanation. And we know that a lack of an explanation
 for something isn't an invitation to invent our favorite explanation.

Skepticism and doubt are our closest friend. If you are here because you think
 you're the next King Arthur, you won't like it here, you'll feel made fun of
 and relegated to the side. We will constantly try to disprove extraordinary
 claims. The same goes for eager believers. We'd rather be populated by people
 under a crisis of faith than by those who've never had one.

## You May Not Belong
There are areas where you don't belong. If you identify as a man, you do not get
 to complain about being excluded from a priestesshood, I don't care how awesome
 they are. If you are an Irish-American person, you don't get to insert yourself
 into conversations about things that don't concern you, especially to
 invalidate the concern or lived experience of a person who is welcome in such a
 conversation.

If people are having a discussion about Co Clare customs and you are not from Co
 Clare and have limited to no information about Co Clare customs, your place of
 belonging is as an asker of questions and a listener. Many conversations on
 culture and identity are derailed by those who are not of said identity,
 against said identity, are peripheral to said identity, or are of said identity
 who have ideologically turned against those within that identity.

In any of these cases, those that care about a thing, live with a thing, share a
 sense of belonging to and with a thing. Those are the folks core to a
 conversation, and who they feel are valuable to include are valuable to
 include.

## Regarding people speaking Celtic languages
Some people speak Celtic languages still. These are extremely insular people who
 if they are harmed by druidry, druidism, neopaganism or the practice of Celtic
 paganism, our respectful practice cannot do them any more harm than they've
 already experienced from both insiders and outsiders.

Leading into the next topic, those who speak a Celtic language have a unique way
 of seeing the world if soft Sapir-Whorfism is true. Our ancestors worldview
 would be as different from current Celtic language speakers as ours is from
 those same speakers. Therefore it is not very likely that anyone will have a
 linguistic worldview similar enough to that held by pagans to matter.
 Therefore, anyone living is as privileged and able as is needed to create and
 use Celtic Pagan worldviews.

However, speakers of Celtic languages are indeed closer to that pagan worldview
 than speakers of any other languages. We can look to them as special persons
 from which we can learn as much as we can. We can contribute the fruits of that
 labor and learning here. Being from a Celtic country and being a speaker of a
 Celtic language, while gives you special popularity, honor, social currency,
 etc... it doesn't automatically make you a good person or a person people want
 to have around, so I wouldn't simply trust a person's behavior, honesty,
 information fidelity based on their language or point of origin.

## Pro Soft Sapir-Whorfism

Sapir-Whorfism is a hypothesis that states your language limits or propels your
 thoughts, and your thoughts limit your worldview, so that speakers of different
 languages have different worldviews. Hard Sapir-Whorfism(which has been
 disproven) states that some thoughts of a person cannot be understood by those
 of a different language. This is called Linguistic Determinism.

Linguistic Relativity, however, is the soft Sapir-Whorfian hypothesis which
 states that languages affect our automatic reality and automatic perception. A
 speakers language affects their worldview.

Examples of this are the perception of time by people who do not have words for
 time, or people's more detailed perception of snow because they have more words
 for kinds of snow. Piraha people only have three counting words: one, two,
 many. As a result, they've proven in studies to be unable to tell the
 difference between four and five accurately on a regular basis.

In this way, Celtic languages who share elements and commonalities with one
 another creates within people a worldview uniquely Celtic that varies from
 language to language. This means we can't have anything to do with a Celtic
 worldview unless we learn some Celtic words and their meaning, potentially how
 to use such words and stringing them together to create or understand a
 communication from another person who also can do this.

One way we know Linguistic Determinism to be false, Ildefonso in 1991 was taught
 sign language for the first time at age 27. He told of past events, which means
 language didn't determine his thoughts as he had no language. Poets like Pablo
 Neruda feel like translations of their works convey the same meaning.

Thought exists before language. Instead of linguistic determinism, we prefer to
 believe that people of differing languages think about and perceive the world
 differently. We discriminate along lexical categorizations.

## Pro Diaspora
Anti-Diaspora attitudes run strong within Jewish Zionist communities. Purists
 are disgusted with their diasporans calling them disfigured, poor, disoriented,
 despised, lacking taste, feeling inferior while also feeling a part of the
 chosen people.

We have a word for not wanting your pure culture or pure race to mix with the
 people of the world, its called racism, and we are anti-racist, so therefore we
 are pro-diaspora where it isn't a forced colonization. If Irish people mix with
 the world, people of some or only Irish descent and people who were mixed with,
 would all benefit from it.

It is a romantic and not a real ideal to return to or keep to any kind of "pure"
 or "authentic" Celtic or Irish connections. It is a hard fact that the cultural
 practices that could be called pagan were often dwindling when committed to
 page before the nineteenth century. Modern people in Ireland with access to
 these customs are *demonstrably* as disconnected from these customs as some
 Irish-American asshole in California.

## Pan-Celtic Practices
There is an important distinction to be made regarding the concept of Pan-Celtic
practices. While it is true that there may not be a unified and homogeneous
Pan-Celtic culture or a singular Pan-Celtic druid order, it is essential to
acknowledge the interconnectedness and shared elements among Celtic cultures.

When we explore Celtic customs and traditions through various sources, we engage
in a process of remixing and reinterpretation. Each generation within a culture
contributes to this ongoing evolution and adaptation, creating unique
expressions of Celtic heritage.

Rather than seeking a singular and all-encompassing Pan-Celtic identity, we can
appreciate the localized manifestations of Celtic practices. Celtic Paganism,
for instance, can be understood and practiced through the lens of specific
linguistic and cultural contexts. It is through this localization that the
richness and diversity of Celtic traditions can be truly embraced.

Arguments surrounding the existence or non-existence of Pan-Celticism become
less relevant when we recognize the fluid nature of cultural expressions.
Instead of striving for a universal and static concept, we can celebrate the
myriad of localized practices that contribute to the tapestry of Celtic
traditions.

It is important to remember that the moment we engage in a specific practice, it
becomes localized and influenced by the unique circumstances of the individuals
and communities involved. Thus, while Pan-Celtic practices may not exist in a
monolithic sense, we can find beauty and meaning in the diverse and localized
expressions of Celtic spirituality.

## Works Without Faith
You can do the rites but they aren't empowered unless you have the teachings.
 It's that simple. Your participation in the gifting cycle will best succeed
 when you know what it is. Therefore you can do gifting cycle rites, but if you
 don't know why or what for, you're not actually doing gifting cycle rites.

## Methodologies and Time Scales
We define the reconstructionist methodology as any method that seeks to arrive
 at modern practices as they would have been given to us without interruptions
 and adheres to the guidelines in the CRFAQ.

Post-reconstructionist methodology involves building upon the foundations of
reconstructionist practices, incorporating additional sources such as
anthropology, archaeology, linguistics, mythology, folklore, and contiguous
arguments. While post-recon methods may explore new interpretations, they still
rely on scholarly research and respect for cultural authenticity.

Post-recon methods build upon recon ones, so using it doesn't mean you'll invent
 practices willy-nilly, without the sciences of anthropology, archeology,
 linguistics, mythology, folklore, and contiguous arguments.

A common post-recon move is to take the precedence of one thing, for example,
 Ogham's use in magical sigils might make someone think it could be used for
 divination. Many recons are really post-recons.

There may be misunderstandings within the pagan community regarding
reconstructionist practices, and it is important to address these misconceptions
with open dialogue and respectful communication. Promoting accurate
understanding of reconstructionism can foster unity and mutual respect among
diverse pagan traditions.

The core ideas in paganisms of Indo-European cultures are set in stone, are
Religions that have stood the test of time over thousands of years often provide
a sense of historical depth and cultural continuity. However, the value and
authenticity of newer religious practices should not be diminished based solely
on their age. Each religious tradition holds its own unique significance and can
contribute to the spiritual well-being of its practitioners.

Often people shun study because it's too hard, but this is the appropriate
 difficulty level of a clergy person.

## Acculturation
The process of acculturating to these praxes and rites, ways of being and
 operating, is strictly and primarily done through the reading and following of
 these texts, and through mentorship by someone ordained as a priest of these
 texts. These texts are the arbiter of this religion and culture. This project
 and these texts have been deeply influenced by my experiences working with the
 Cailleach of Cahercalla, who, I believe, inspires diverse approaches among
 individuals who engage with her.

This may not go anywhere, nor might it become popular... if it simply serves as
 a basis for a small group of followers of this cult-worship, it has well served
 a purpose. These texts belong to those who immerse and steep themselves within
 them. Those who deeply appreciate these texts should have the opportunity to
 belong to this community. The guidance of these texts should be informed by the
 collective wisdom and diverse perspectives of its followers. "Average opinion"
 here simply means the calculated middle of all extremes divided by the number
 of extremes. The wisdom of the crowd provides error correction that the
 visionaries cannot see, just as the visionaries in a group provide a path
 forward that the crowd cannot yet see.

The means of acculturation is immersion in this lore and its people. This lore
 provides almost nothing for those interested in autocratic pride in separation
 from the tribe. Solo practitioners among us are just our people disconnected
 from one of our locus of culture. While solo practitioners who actively choose
 to be anti-social or hostile towards others may not find a sense of belonging
 within this group, we strive to create a welcoming space for individuals with
 diverse preferences and circumstances. Dennis Jennings pointed out that many
 people in our society often seek something authentic due to a perceived
 spiritual void.
   
   note: "Is a spiritual vacuum that this society we live in, it creates people
   that are looking for something that is real. - Dennis Jennings[^jennings]

## Appropriation
A group of people taking a heritage they have access and rights to, tracking it
 with perfect diligence, defining the praxes and precedents of it, and making it
 available for acculturation, help reduce appropriation. It doesn't just pay it
 lip-service by a technical and legal loopholes, open-sourcing a culture, like
 open-sourcing software, eliminates the number of imitators because they can
 just get the real detailed information.

In our modern world, especially in North America, we are in a culture which
 produces people who are longing and yearning for connection to something deeply
 rooted. If you don't give them good information, they will imitate what they
 see and fill in the holes.

It's bigger than simply the idea that indigenous people have nicer ceremonies
 and we want them too. Sometimes, I come across reconstructions that seem to
 imitate elements from multiple cultural traditions, blending symbols such as
 warpaint and runes with emphasis on various accessories.

It is worth noting that some individuals of American-Indian descent choose to
 perform their ceremonies in plain attire like suits or jeans, not reflecting the
 influence of Western materialism. The clothes making the man is not a tenant
 of cultures which are dwelling in the same place as the homeland of their
 language.

Therefore, acculturation to something new and complex involves changing
 fundamental ideas at the root of your worldview like clothes making the man. We
 cannot control, nor do we wish to control, what other people do with this
 repository. What we can do is place restrictions on closing these texts, make
 sure the texts contain valuable and accurate information, and promote a certain
 set of attitudes that when held creates a sacred and respectable Celtic
 Paganism within most people.

## Picking and Choosing
Explore the diverse array of available resources to learn about and engage with
Celtic and Indo-European cultures. Compile your own personal Celtic Pagan
Operating System. Like a university offering various majors, you can specialize
in one or more areas of interest. This allows individuals and households to
develop unique practices based on authentic sources of instruction. Incorporate
aspects of these practices that align with your personal goals and values.

It is important to approach these traditions with respect and cultural
sensitivity, acknowledging the rich heritage they encompass. Individuals who
adapt these texts towards different goals or attitudes, even if licensed to do
so, should be mindful of the cultural context and potential impacts. Instead of
focusing on comparisons, we celebrate the different paths individuals follow
within these traditions.

## Emulation Instead of Imitation
While emulation is defined by imitation, it is much more than poor imitation.

Emulation is an form of imitation that takes seriously all of a system or
 processes inputs and outputs and tries to arrange them correctly until it
 functions in an identical way to the original form.

Playstation consoles, for instance, operate on code that people cannot see.

However, people create their own code to handle the inputs and outputs so that
 the game will run, sometimes poorly. Poorly emulated games just need more time
 to develop. A key point of emulation is that you know how something is supposed
 to function though you cannot see the processes which make it do so.

There is currently no form of Celtic paganism that isn't emulated or imitated
 since the original is long gone and since the contents of the original is up to
 speculation. However, Academic pursuits equip us with a lot of tools to
 illuminate the likely options, which we can, like emulators, try and see if the
 experiences described in texts recorded by mystics.

People emulating Celtic Paganism sometimes claim to be more authentic than
 others, but such claims are basically made for internet keywords because that
 what people expect and search for. Sure people are better than others at
 emulating what might have happened in the iron age, and some people are better
 at being clergy today. Which is more important?
 
Additionally, authority vocalization and language is the number one factor
 people use to judge authority. So its enticing to cast a circle of validity and
 lord over it. But this can't be done by people with a serious and intelligent
 mind who place authenticity within the realms of intellectual honesty.

The fact that there are no practicer of original Celtic paganism, it puts
 everyone on the same footing and labels everyone an emulator.

## Troubles

One year ago I had some volume issues and it's taken me 12 months to be able to
devote time to this. I basically rebuilt all the features in vuepress but
manually within [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev).

11ty creates a fully rendered site upon build. It is highly manually templated
and the result of using it is a very plain site.
[11straps](https://11straps.com/) will at least get you a bootstrapped eleventy
site.

However, what you end up with compared to vuepress or vuepress-theme-hope2, is
rather simple and still disappointing for a documentation or encyclopedic site.

Over the past 12 months I've been rebuilding the features I appreciate from
vuepress-theme-hope2 and vuepress into my 11straps project. The result is a
fast, and infinite pages rendering of the data you put into it. Unlike vuepress
it doesn't load all the pages in the background, instead it seeks to load
everything locally. All third party libraries are either served locally from
this host rather than from CDN, or are yet to be moved to a local folder to be
served from there.

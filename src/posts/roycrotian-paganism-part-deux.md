## Roycroftian Paganism
1. **Appreciation for Handmade Religious Practices**: In developing OpenOrdú and
  this variance of Celtic Paganism, we put emphasis and value on the careful and
  manual creation of rites, poetry and praxes. Roycroftian practitioners collect
  and create own personal religious texts or scripts, perhaps written by hand in a
  journals or hand typed, curated by the eyes and the mind. This our parallel to
  Roycroft's emphasis on handmade goods. Just as religious text of every religion
  was made by some diligent monk or holy person in an act of devotion, every
  keystroke to these texts is a prayer to Fírinne. The act of writing itself is
  our meditative practice, so we foster a deeper connection with the spiritual
  teachings we make, use, and rework.

2. **Dignity and Worth of Deepened Practice through Manual Study:** In embracing
  OpenOrdú and our interpretation of Celtic Paganism, we esteem the
  conscientious application of time and effort to enrich our spiritual
  understanding. Much as the Roycrofters esteemed manual labor, we see the
  study of our faith as a labor of love and devotion. This may involve poring
  over historical sources, learning ancient tongues, or mindfully engaging with
  the natural world in our practice. The wisdom we glean is our testament to
  our devotion, a hand-etched tapestry of our spiritual journey.

3. **Commitment to Quality:** The OpenOrdú path demands an unwavering commitment
  to the highest quality of spiritual practice. Our parallel to the Roycroft
  ethos of craftsmanship is a dedication to a mindful and deliberate engagement
  with the tenets and rituals of our faith. Our spiritual journey is not marked
  by the ticking of a clock but rather the depths to which we understand and
  connect with our beliefs.

4. **Ritual & Devotion as Artistic Expression:** Within the OpenOrdú community,
  ritual and devotion transcend the mundane to become works of art. Drawing
  from the Roycroft belief of crafting as a form of artistry, our personal and
  communal rituals, hand-crafted ceremonial tools, and unique expressions of
  honor to our gods and goddesses are our canvases. Each prayer whispered, each
  symbol etched, is a stroke of our spiritual brush.

5. **Importance of Community:** In line with the Roycrofters' value of a
  supportive community, we believe that our spiritual journey is enriched by
  the collective wisdom and shared experiences of our community. We learn from
  each other, grow with each other, and honor the sacred together. Our communal
  rituals are a dance of unity, our shared knowledge a library of collective
  wisdom.

6. **Solitary & Group Enrichment:** Guided by the Roycroft ideal of personal and
  collective enrichment, our solitary and communal practices in Celtic Paganism
  serve to nourish our spiritual selves and fortify our communal bonds with
  conflict resolution, the increase of good communication skills and self
  awareness. Our individual quests for enlightenment inspire our communal
  rituals, and the shared experiences therein further enrich our solitary
  journeys.

7. **Rebellion against Soul-Crushing Paradigms:** Channeling the rebellious spirit
  of the Roycrofters against the industrial age, we, as Celtic Pagans, rebel
  against oppressive societal norms, hyper-individualism, hyper-communalism, and
  anything from imperialistic or colonial mindsets. Our faith serves as a vessel
  to reconnect with our ancestral wisdom, honor our ties to nature, and reclaim
  our spiritual autonomy which we call personal Sovereignty. Each chant, each
  ritual, each moment of meditation, is our stand against spiritual oppression.

8. **Advocacy for Unique Dividualism:** Our divergence from the Roycroft ethos
  of individualism lies in our embrace of dividualism and really isn't a
  divergence to insiders. In practicing OpenOrdú, we see ourselves as
  constellations of interconnected parts which circulate within the clan –
  personal experiences, ancestral connections, with modern [tribal
  bonds](vision). We celebrate our uniqueness while honoring our collective
  identity, embodying the essence of our Celtic Paganism in every facet of our
  faith. Since many of us identify with our practice so thoroughly we would die
  for our convictions, this is certainly true as this repository has been
  inserted with elements of practice which circulate within this community.
  Therefore we certainly have put our souls into this, and then into you the
  reader as you pick up what we've been putting down.

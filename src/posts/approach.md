summary: 'This post explores optimal strategies for guide creation in a project: Bottom-Up, Top-Down, and Straddle (Hybrid). It weighs the pros and cons of each, considering factors like attention capture, recruitment timelines, and potential project completion. The conclusion suggests the Straddle approach, balancing laity attraction and priest recruitment, as the method with least risk and most benefits.'

This is a layout to explore which method is best to determine the proper order
of the creation of the guides section of this project.

| Strategy | Order of Creation | Pros | Cons |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Bottom-Up | Lay programs, bard, seer, druid | Captures attention of laity with regular resources | May take a long time to recruit priests to assist |
| Top-Down | Druid, seer, bard, lay programs | Attracts priests early to help with the project | Might delay capturing attention of lay people and regular practitioners |
| Straddle (Hybrid) | Lay programs, Druid programs, other programs afterward | Attracts laity and builds a priesthood to assist with the project | Risk of an incomplete project with lack of content for witchy, mantic, or bardic programs if momentum is lost |


## Bottom Up
* Lay programs first, bard second, seer third, druid fifth
* PCE throughout

### Cons
* Take forever to get prieists to help you build the project.
* 
### Pros
* Get attention of laity by providing regular resources.

## Top Down
* Druid first, seer second, bard thrid, lay programs last.
* PCE throughout

### Cons
* Take forever to get the attention of lay ppl, regular practitioners
 
### Pros
* Attract priests to help you build the project faster as you go.

## Stradle Approach

* Lay programs first, Druid programs 2nd, other programs afterward.

## Cons
* Potential to have an unfinished product of laity and priests, but no witchy,
  mantic or bardic programs if the project runs out of steam before attracting
  contributors.

## Pros
* Attract laity at the right time.
* Build a priesthood which can help you build the remaining parts sooner.

# Conclusion
I think the last option, a staggered approach has the least amount of risk, the
most amount of benefit.

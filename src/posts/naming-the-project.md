I chose the name `openordú` because it means to me: an open order, an open
priesthood. I'm not going to get a new domain name just yet. Cporg has not yet
lost its value. Getting a new domain, such as name _openordú.org_ or something,
might be most appropriate to appearances, but the domain name
_celticpaganism.org_ is most appropriate to the [goals](../goals.md) of the
project.

I often reflect on the connection between the open clan, the Ó Déisí, and the
dynamics of clan life in relation to this project. Considering any attempt to
separate them feels like engaging in colonial gymnastics. It is important to
acknowledge that culture cannot be separated from its people. While this project
is open for use by individuals, groves, covens, and other clans, it is deeply
intertwined with the [Ó Déisí](/posts/letter-mission.html) people. The
open-source effort of this project represents the organic development of a
culture that naturally emerges within the context of a clan, with individuals
who are drawn together by a shared practice.

> A culture cannot be separated from its people.

However, OpenOrder works on two levels, the concept of a druid college, and the
concept of orders of ritual, a notion about rites which predates but is codified
in the earliest Celtic Church writings like the Stowe Missal and the Book of
Deer.

## Project Mission

Mission Statement of OpenOrdú:

I. Purpose:
The primary purpose of OpenOrdú is to establish and maintain a digital platform dedicated to the exploration, preservation, and dissemination of knowledge pertaining to Celtic Paganism, Celtic Reconstructionism, Celtic Post-reconstructionism, and Neodruidism.

II. Open-Source Principles:
OpenOrdú shall operate in accordance with the principles of open-source software, encouraging users to access, create, and share resources freely. This includes, but is not limited to, common works, records of discourse, canonical texts, translations, and metadata.

III. Licensing:
OpenOrdú shall employ a licensing model that allows for the unrestricted use, modification, and distribution of content, subject to proper attribution and adherence to established licensing agreements. The organization shall follow the precedents set by software licensing to ensure the integrity and accessibility of its content.

IV. User Engagement and Collaboration:
OpenOrdú shall provide a platform for user-generated content, fostering an environment that encourages collaboration, contribution, and the exchange of ideas. This shall be achieved through a system that facilitates content review, modification, and integration into the main body of knowledge.

V. Quality Assurance and Content Management:
OpenOrdú shall maintain a commitment to ensuring the quality and accuracy of its content by implementing a system for content review and approval. This system shall involve a tiered approach to user contributions, ensuring that only high-quality, relevant, and accurate content is integrated into the main repository.

VI. Preservation of Knowledge and Adaptability:
OpenOrdú shall serve as a reliable and enduring source of knowledge, adaptable to changes in the field of study and resilient to the rise and fall of organizations or institutions. By maintaining a decentralized and flexible repository, OpenOrdú aims to guarantee the longevity and accessibility of the shared knowledge for future generations.

VII. Ó Déisí Clan Society and Worldwide Subgroup Affiliations:
In addition to serving as a digital platform for the preservation and dissemination of knowledge, OpenOrdú shall also function as a clan society, known as the Ó Déisí Clan Society. Members of the Ó Déisí Clan Society will be considered as having a bond akin to legal kinship or milk-kinship with the Bean Sí, fostering a sense of community and shared identity among its members.

The Ó Déisí Clan Society shall facilitate the establishment and affiliation of worldwide subgroups, referred to as Septs. These Septs will serve as local communities or churches that practice the religion supported by OpenOrdú, promoting the values and principles of the platform within their respective localities.

The Septs shall operate in accordance with the mission and bylaws of OpenOrdú, while also maintaining the autonomy to adapt their practices to suit the needs and preferences of their local communities. Septs are encouraged to form their own organizations in their local regions, independent of OpenOrdú's IRS affiliations. Reporting to OpenOrdú is not required for a Sept to remain active, allowing for greater flexibility and autonomy in their operations.

By fostering a global network of interconnected Septs, the Ó Déisí Clan Society aims to cultivate a sense of unity and belonging among its members, while simultaneously promoting the growth and development of the religion and practices supported by OpenOrdú.

## Project Vision

In a world faced with mounting challenges such as climate change-driven mass migrations, rising sea levels, and a rapidly evolving digital economy, Celtic Paganism serves as a vital coping mechanism for many. As humanity ventures forth into space, explores the realms of the gods, or seeks refuge in underground seed arks, OpenOrdú aims to remain relevant and accessible across time and space.

Designed to be easily stored, shared, and distributed on small drives, the

 knowledge and resources provided by OpenOrdú will accompany humanity wherever it goes. By translating the content into numerous languages and archiving it in countless data centers, future generations will be able to access and benefit from this rich heritage.

OpenOrdú seeks to overcome the limitations of traditional institutions by establishing a dynamic, community-driven platform that encourages contributions and collaboration. By embracing the principles of open-source religion and utilizing a git project, OpenOrdú allows for the continuous evolution of ideas, ensuring the relevance and adaptability of Celtic Paganism in a changing world.

Through the implementation of a sensible system of contributor tenuring and tiered approvals, OpenOrdú maintains the integrity of the project while embracing diverse perspectives. It aims to be an academic-quality publication that encourages practice, transcending organizational boundaries and serving as a foundation for countless guides and resources.

## Licensing

We are adapting the Creative Commons Attribution ShareAlike 4.0 License by removing the requirement to indicate modifications and prohibiting changes to author tags. The modified license will be called the Celtic Culture Attribution-ShareAlike 1.0 International Public License.

Licensing religious works addresses several issues:

1. Preservation and accessibility of knowledge: Ensuring that valuable information about Celtic Paganism, Celtic Reconstructionism, Celtic Post-reconstructionism, and Neodruidism is preserved, maintained, and easily accessible for future generations.
2. Adaptability and resilience of the community: Addressing the challenges faced by humanity, such as climate change, mass migrations, and a changing digital economy, by creating a flexible, adaptable, and easily distributable repository of knowledge and practices that can be carried forward and utilized in various contexts.
3. Lack of sustainable institutions: Recognizing the difficulty in establishing long-lasting institutions like Druid Colleges or oral traditions in the modern world and providing an alternative solution through a text-based platform that aligns with contemporary culture.
4. Encouraging collaboration and contribution: Creating an open-source, community-driven platform that allows individuals with diverse backgrounds and expertise to contribute to the development and evolution of the knowledge base while maintaining quality standards and preventing the infiltration of undesirable elements.
5. Addressing limitations of existing platforms: Overcoming the challenges faced by platforms like Wikipedia, where contributions by experts in the field may be stifled or reverted, by creating a dedicated space for highly trained specialists to share their knowledge and insights.
6. Decentralization and independence from organizations: Ensuring that the repository is not tied to any specific organization or denomination, allowing the lore to be maintained and utilized independently of the rise or fall of individual institutions.
7. Transparency and accountability: Utilizing a git repository system to maintain a comprehensive history of changes and contributions, allowing for transparency and protection against religious revisionism.

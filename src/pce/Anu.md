# Anu

Irish mythology features Anu, also known as Ana or Danu, a mother goddess with little known information. In southwestern Ireland, two hills named Dá Chich Danann are crowned with prehistoric Cairns and resemble stone nipples on her great breasts. The hills are either named after Anu or could be considered identical to Danu, ancestor of the Tuatha Dé Danann, depending on differing viewpoints. Cormac, an early glossarist, lists Anu as "mother of the gods of Ireland" and associated with abundance, but there are no existing stories or myths to describe her characteristics. Some believe that Anu could be the same as Áine of Limerick, Black Annis of Britain, or a separate goddess of abundance altogether. During Christian times, Anu was combined with St. Anne, grandmother of Jesus, and several holy wells dedicated to Anu/St. Anne exist in Wales, such as that in Llanmihangel where St. Anne is featured in a flowing fountain. In Welsh mythology, there is a similar figure named Ána or Anu, considered by Rhys and others to be connected to the Irish mother goddess Anu.

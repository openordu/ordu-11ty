# Arthur

Arthur, a British hero, became the subject of an enduring tale that originated in sixth-century Wales and gained popularity after the 12th-century writings of British author, Geoffrey of Monmouth. In his History of the Kings of Britain (ca. 1136), Monmouth blended mythology, history, and romance, inspiring artists and writers in England and France. Additionally, the Arthurian cycle owes much of its legendary status to the verse romances of the 12th-century French poet Chrétien de Troyes, who introduced the Grail theme into the Arthurian legend. Over the centuries, the story of King Arthur was popularized in literary and cultural contexts, including Sir Thomas Malory’s Le Morte d’Arthur (1485), Alfred Tennyson’s Idylls of the King (1859–85), and T. H. White’s The Once and Future King (1958). It has since inspired numerous works of art and entertainment such as the popular musical Camelot, the film Excalibur, and the novel, The Mists of Avalon. The Arthurian cycle, collectively referred to as the Matter of Britain, expanded to include related tales of characters such as Percival and Tristan, as well as the Fisher King and Grail cycles, which have resulted in thousands of interpretations. Though rooted in Celtic mythology, the Arthurian tales have evolved through literary transmission. While literary scholars may recognize Celtic and even pre-Celtic mythological patterns underlying the tales, such an interpretation remains largely speculative. Arthur has captured the popular imagination as an historical king of sixth-century C.E. Britain for much of the past thousand years. Camelot, his court, is seen as offering a true picture of the possibility of nobleness as well as a tragic depiction of betrayal. The reality of an early Celtic king named Arthur now seems assured, but the power of his story is mythical rather than merely historical, with many variants of his legend. The story usually follows roughly similar outlines, with Arthur being born of royal blood after his father utilized Merlin's magic to sleep with his mother, Igraine, through deceit, while appearing in the form of her husband. At birth, Arthur was snatched away by Merlin and fostered away from the royal seat. Arthur was only accepted as ruler when he performed a feat no one else had managed: to extract a magical sword from a stone that it pierced. Assuming his rightful place as king, Arthur established an idealistic court of noble knights who met around a great Round Table at Camelot, among whom were Percival, Lancelot, and Kay, while married to the rapturously beautiful Guinevere. All of Britain was at peace under their reign. Arthur, a figure in folklore, is characterized as the embodiment of masculinity and sovereignty. He displays strength, excelling both as a warrior and strategist, successfully repelling opposing armies from his kingdom. Furthermore, he is a charismatic leader whom the noblest of knights are drawn to, inspiring their affection and loyalty. In some tales, Arthur is a trickster character who steals the mystical Cauldron of Plenty from the Otherworld. Additionally, he is also a skilled Bard, fluent in poetry and song. Despite his benevolence and generosity, things do not go well in Camelot. Lancelot, a handsome knight, and queen Guinevere fall in love; Lancelot eventually exiles himself instead of betraying his king. Nevertheless, their love for each other grew too strong to resist, causing the crops to fail for seven years while Arthur struggled to uncover the reason. Meanwhile, Mordred, Arthur's estranged son and Morgause's offspring, started to wage war against him. During the tumultuous war, Arthur was mortally wounded, but rather than succumbing to his wounds, he was escorted by cryptic ladies to Avalon after casting Excalibur into a lake, consequently becoming the "once and future king." Among the various mythological elements that herald a Celtic background for the myth is the emphasis on the king's probity, which reflects on the prosperity of the land itself. However, Camelot crumbled not because of the king's parsimony, the usual failing of Celtic rulers, but rather his reluctance to doubt his wife and apparently devoted knight. Some researchers have posited that the stories deviate significantly from the typical Celtic template, leading them to speculate about a pre-Celtic source for the legends. Guinevere, in this interpretation, might represent an ancient goddess who picked and discarded kings--a narrative thread that Marion Zimmer Bradley adapted for her well-liked novel, The Mists of Avalon. It remains an open question whether Arthur had his origins as a British or Welsh deity; his name can be linked etymologically to the celestial Bear in Welsh (arth), yet there is evidence both for his status as a Celtic (most likely Brythonic) divinity, and for his existence as a culture hero inspired by a historical monarch, depending on which scholars one consults.

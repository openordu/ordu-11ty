# afanc (avanc)

A gigantic creature known as the Afanc, or Avanc, is believed to have haunted the River Conwy in North Wales. Often taking on the form of a giant beaver, although sometimes appearing as a crocodile, this Welsh monster made its home in a ferocious whirlpool. It is surprising that such a beast was given a name meaning “dwarf” or “water-dwarf”—a clear contradiction to its monstrous size. Nonetheless, legends implied that the Afanc could be tamed, but only if a maiden could entice it to come to her lap similar to the taming of a unicorn. However, the Afanc would flee back to its lake home, and the maiden who tried to tame it would lose her life.

A heroine of Arthurian legend, Alice la Beale Pilgrim was a distant relative of the renowned knight Lancelot, and the beloved of Alisander Le Orphelin. Alice's face was always obscured by a veil. A figure of secondary importance in Arthurian folklore, Alisander le Orphelin was held captive by Morgan, who took the guise of a Fairy Queen and was unable to tempt the chaste hero. A similar tale is recounted of Lancelot, with some suggesting that the two knights are identical or comparable characters.

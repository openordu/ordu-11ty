Continental Celtic goddess, Arduinna, also known as Ardwinna, Arduenna, or Arduanna, was known for riding a wild Boar through the Gaulish forest named after her, the Ardennes. She is sometimes linked to the Roman Diana or Greek Artemis. Hunters were permitted in Arduinna's forest, but only if they left money in exchange for the animals they killed. The etymology of her name may include "ard," meaning "highland" or "height."

Invoked by the warrior queen Boudicca of the British tribe, the Iceni, before leading her troops into battle against the Roman invaders, Andraste, the British goddess whose name means "invincibility," embodied a formidable defense. The ritual of Boudicca to Andraste employed the symbolic release of a Hare, endemic to Ireland and an occasional symbol of the warrior queen and goddess Medb. Although appearing to be a timid beast for a war divinity at first glance, the hare is capable of fierce defense when threatened, and thus is an appropriate image of defense. In her quest to drive the Romans from her land, Boudicca came close to succeeding, but with the tides of war turned against her, she chose to end her own life rather than submit to the ignominies the Romans heaped upon their conquered enemies.

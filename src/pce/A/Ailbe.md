Ailbe, also known as Ailba, is a creature from Irish mythology. This famous hunting dog belonged to Mac Dath贸, a warrior who aimed to please two powerful provincial kings. Both Concobar Mac Nessa, the king of Ulster, and Ailill Mac Mata, the king of Connacht, desired the dog. Mac Dath贸 promised it to both of them, causing an argument that eventually led to the death of the dog.

Irish mythology features the enigmatic Airech, a hero who does not hold a prominent role except as the individual responsible for navigating the vessel helmed by the enigmatic Donn. Amairgin, the famed Bard of the Milesians served as Airechâ€™s foster father. It is suggested that Donn may represent the sovereign of death and, therefore, Airech functions as the pilot of the death boat.

A slender, graceful tree known as the alder (genus Alnus) holds tiny cones and dangling catkins on its branches, making it a sacred tree in Celtic culture. The Celts linked the alder to Divination and prognostication, and this connection lasted in Scotland into the early modern period. The alder was so revered that in ancient times, cutting it down was considered a kind of murder because the tree seemed to have a human-like spirit. Folk tales also emphasize the sacredness of alders, such as the belief that the Fairy folk used it to cover their theft of cattle from humans, leaving enchanted boughs of alder in place of the cattle they took away. In Wales, the hero Brân, The Blessed was associated with the alder, and the poet Gwydion was able to identify Brân based on the alder branch he carried.

Irish mythology recounts the story of Aibheaeg, a divine being or fairy. In Donegal, she was considered a Fairy Queen or goddess and venerated at a "well of fire." According to folklore, the water from this well was a potent cure for toothaches. Those seeking her aid would leave a white stone in exchange for relief from their affliction. While the association of wells with toothache was uncommon, it was more closely tied to healing eye diseases, as in the case of Brigit.

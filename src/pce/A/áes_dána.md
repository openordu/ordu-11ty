A group of acclaimed artists in Ireland are known as áes dána (aos dana, aes dana), a term derived from the Old Irish word for poets. This term was also used to refer to Druids, Brehons, and lawyers. To obtain the gift of inspiration, one had to consume the Hazel nuts that floated in the Well of wisdom, drink from it, or taste the flesh of the Salmon that swam in it. áes sídhe (aos shee, aos sidhe) corresponds to Fairies.

Irish hero Cormac Mac Airt was born to Achtan, a notable heroine, under very unusual circumstances. Before heading to a battle where he expected to die, King Art Mac Cuinn stopped at Achtan's house for the night. There, Achtan's father, the Smith Olc Acha, foretold Art that sleeping with his daughter would bring the lover everlasting fame, a prophecy that intrigued Art. With the potential of offspring from the encounter in mind, Art informed Achtan that his friend Lugna would be responsible for the fostering of the child. Achtan became pregnant that night, but Art died in battle before they could reunite. As she approached her term, Achtan embarked on a journey to Connacht to find Lugna's home. She went into labor during a thunderstorm at the border of the province, where she wandered away to seek aid, leaving her child behind. A mother Wolf then protected and nursed the child in Achtan's absence. Many years later, a hunter discovered a robust young man who was raised by the wolf-mother, and he was reunited with Achtan. Alongside her son, she moved to Tara to claim the throne, with her son reigning as Cormac mac Airt. Achtan then married the hunter and lived near her son.

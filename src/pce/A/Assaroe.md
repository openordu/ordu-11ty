The site of Assaroe on the River Erne in Co. Sligo, renowned in legend, is home to the famous Assaroe waterfall which was submerged when a hydroelectric dam was built in the vicinity during the mid-20th century. It is said that Fionn Mac Cumhaill unknowingly consumed the Salmon of Wisdom (also known as Goll Essa Ruaid) here, which was being waited upon for seven years by the druid Finnéces, according to certain tales. The father of the woman warrior MacHA Mong Rua, Áed Ruad (or Áed the Red), also passed away at this site, resulting in the naming of the waterfall as Eas Ruadh, meaning "the red waterfall" in Irish. Another version of the story indicates that the falls were named after a goddess named Ruad, who drowned there upon being enticed to her demise by the songs of Mermaids. While sailing aboard the vessel of the poet Abcán in her pursuit of a human lover (referred to as a "Fairy Lover"), she perished before being able to reach him. The drowning of a goddess in a river is a common mythological motif in Irish lore, symbolizing the dispersal of her divine power into the water which then bestows life-giving properties to the earth.

British goddess, Arnemetia, is associated with the word Nemeton, meaning "in front of the sacred grove." The shrine of this goddess, located in present-day Buxton Spa in Derbyshire, was known as Aquae Arnementiae by Romans. It was named after two mineral springs that were located nearby. Post the Christianization period, Arnemetia was identified as St. Anne.

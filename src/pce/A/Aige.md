Irish heroine Aige became the victim of a wicked Fairy's spell, instigated by jealous neighbors who envied Aige's elegance and appeal. The spell resulted in her transformation into a wild doe, compelling her to roam the island, evading hunters, until a warrior named Meilge hunted and killed her. Faifne, Aige's brother and a satirist, attempted to avenge her death, but to his misfortune, lost his own life in this pursuit.

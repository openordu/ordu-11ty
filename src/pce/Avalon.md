# Avalon

Site of British mythology called Avalon (Afallon). During the time that Arthur, the ruler of Camelot, was nearing his end, he was taken by mysterious women in a boat to Avalon, an Island of Apples that typifies the Celtic Otherworld. Avalon was a stunning locale with moderate weather and eternal spring, where fruits and flowers could be found simultaneously on trees and where there were never any storms. There was a queen who ruled over the place, referred to at times as Argante, who, along with her virginal attendants, were renowned as great healers. In some legends, a shadowy figure referred to as Avalloc was believed to be the king of Avalon. Although Glastonbury in southwest England now has a connection with Avalon, this appears to be a post-Celtic association potentially derived from the original name of Ynys-witrin, meaning "glass island." To the Celts, Avalon was clearly one of the western isles in the Otherworld where the divine and the dead existed together.

# Abcán

Abcán was a god from the Irish mythology who was associated with the Tuatha Dé Danann, a group of early Celtic gods from Ireland. In one story, Ruad, a goddess, was transported from the Otherworld to our world in Abcán's boat, which was made of bronze and had a tin sail. They arrived at the famous waterfall of Assaroe and it was there that Ruad eventually died. The reason for her death was because she was lured into the swirling waters by the singing of Mermaids from Abcán's boat. In another text, it was said that Abcán was captured by Cúchulainn, a great hero from Ulster, but was able to escape by playing irresistible lullabies that put the warrior to sleep. Abcán shares many similarities with Fer Í, a dwarf musician, and may be related to him.

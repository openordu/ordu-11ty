Obscure as she may be, Alend is an Irish goddess or heroine and her name was bestowed upon the great ancient capital of the eastern Irish province of Leinster, Almu. Little narrative exists to describe Alend, but she is characterized as royal and heroic. Today, the Hill of Allen in Co. Kildare stands in the place of the previous capital and this goddess is also the namesake of the Bog of Allen.

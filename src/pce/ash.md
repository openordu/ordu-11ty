# ash

The ash tree, belonging to the genus Fraxinus, is a significant symbol in the mythologies of the Celts, Scandinavians, and Germanic peoples, despite being a common tree in many climates. Its sweeping, upturned branches and feathery compound leaves create a dramatic pattern against the winter sky and a dappled shade in summer. Along with the Oak and the Thorn, the ash is considered one of the magical trees of Celtic tradition. It was believed to repel fairies, and Scottish Highland mothers would feed a newborn child with sap from a green ash branch burned to ward off harm. In the Cotswolds, crafting an ash tree into a whip handle was thought to protect against witchcraft. The ash also had curative powers and was used to prevent rickets by passing children through young ash branches slashed in two, then left to heal. Ashwood was believed to have general protective powers against evil. Beltane, the spring festival celebrated on May 1, is associated with the ash tree, especially on the hill of Uisneach in Ireland. Ash trees on this site were considered especially potent, and it was said that an impossibly tall ash tree on Uisneach's summit, which had fallen in prehistory, suggested a world-axis that may have originally ascended from Uisneach. Ireland boasts several well-known ash trees, including the holy tree of Clenore, believed to be home to the spirit or saint Creeva. The ash tree held such importance in Irish mythology that three of the five most significant mythological trees were ash. The ash family includes varieties like the square-twigged blue ash and the common green ash, with the Rowan or mountain ash belonging to a different genus. Ash trees thrive near water, making them a common sight near holy Wells, where the combination of ash and water was considered especially powerful. It was believed that miracles could occur when ash trees "bled" or oozed sap into the well, and people would gather the liquid for its potential elixir-like qualities.

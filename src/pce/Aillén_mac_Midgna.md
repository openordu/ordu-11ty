A notorious member of the Tuatha Dé Danann was Aillén mac Midgna (or Midna, or Midhna), also known as "the burner." Aillén was a musician whose music had such a hypnotic effect that the defenders of Tara, whose great halls were burned down by Aillén for 23 years in a row, fell asleep and could not resist. Aillén retreated to his Fairy Mound at Finnachaid each year, leaving Tara to be rebuilt. However, after years of destruction, the hero Fionn Mac Cumhaill killed Aillén with a poisoned spear that caused insomnia to anyone who breathed its fumes, including those who had been lulled by Aillén's music. Finnachaid was said to be the home not only of Aillén, but also of the tragic King Lir.
